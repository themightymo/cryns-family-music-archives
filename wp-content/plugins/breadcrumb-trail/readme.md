# Breadcrumb Trail #

A powerful script for adding breadcrumbs to your site that supports Schema.org, HTML5-valid microdata.

Breadcrumb Trail is one of the most advanced and robust breadcrumb menu systems available for WordPress.  It started out as a small script for basic blogs but has grown into a system that can handle nearly any site's setup to show the most accurate breadcrumbs for each page.

## Usage ##

This script won't work automatically because there's no way for me to know where it should show within your theme.  You'll have to add it manually in your template files.  You can add it pretty much anywhere you want, but I usually recommend near the bottom of your theme's `header.php` template.

The basic code you need is:

	<?php breadcrumb_trail(); ?>

Actually, you should always wrap it in a `functions_exists()` check too like so:

	<?php if ( function_exists( 'breadcrumb_trail' ) ) breadcrumb_trail(); ?>

That's all you need to do to add breadcrumbs to your site.  Of course, you can customize that a bit.

### Parameters ###

The `breadcrumb_trail()` function accepts a single parameter of `$args`, which is an array of arguments for deciding how your breadcrumbs should behave.  The default arguments are the following.

	$defaults = array(
			'container'       => 'div',   // container element
			'separator'       => '&#47;', // separator between items
			'before'          => '',      // HTML to output before
			'after'           => '',      // HTML to output after
			'show_on_front'   => true,    // whether to show on front
			'network'         => false,   // whether to create trail back to main site (multisite)
			'show_title'      => true,    // whether to show the current page title
			'show_browse'     => true,    // whether to show the "browse" text
			'echo'            => true,    // whether to echo or return the breadcrumbs

			/* Post taxonomy (examples follow). */
			'post_taxonomy' => array(
				// 'post'  => 'post_tag', // 'post' post type and 'post_tag' taxonomy
				// 'book'  => 'genre',    // 'book' post type and 'genre' taxonomy
			),

			/* Labels for text used (see Breadcrumb_Trail::default_labels). */
			'labels' => array(
				'browse'              => __( 'Browse:',                             'breadcrumb-trail' ),
				'home'                => __( 'Home',                                'breadcrumb-trail' ),
				'error_404'           => __( '404 Not Found',                       'breadcrumb-trail' ),
				'archives'            => __( 'Archives',                            'breadcrumb-trail' ),
				/* Translators: %s is the search query. The HTML entities are opening and closing curly quotes. */
				'search'              => __( 'Search results for &#8220;%s&#8221;', 'breadcrumb-trail' ),
				/* Translators: %s is the page number. */
				'paged'               => __( 'Page %s',                             'breadcrumb-trail' ),
				/* Translators: Minute archive title. %s is the minute time format. */
				'archive_minute'      => __( 'Minute %s',                           'breadcrumb-trail' ),
				/* Translators: Weekly archive title. %s is the week date format. */
				'archive_week'        => __( 'Week %s',                             'breadcrumb-trail' ),
	
				/* "%s" is replaced with the translated date/time format. */
				'archive_minute_hour' => '%s',
				'archive_hour'        => '%s',
				'archive_day'         => '%s',
				'archive_month'       => '%s',
				'archive_year'        => '%s',
			)
	);

* The `show_on_front` argument should only work if the front page is not paginated.

### Version 0.6.0 ###

* [Schema.org](http://schema.org) support.

* Use `post_type_archive_title()` on post type archives in the trail.
* Add support for taxonomies that have a `$rewrite->slug` that matches a string value for a custom post type's `has_archive` argument.

* Loads of pagination support on both archive-type pages and paged single posts.
* Added support for hierarchical custom post types (get parent posts).
* Added the `network` argument to allow multisite owners to run the trail all the way back to the main site.

* Changed license from GPL 2-only to GPL 2+.
* Smarter handling of the `trail-begin` and `trail-end` classes.
