Add a beautiful HTML Template to all WordPress and plugin generated emails. Send email options - SMTP, Gmail, Mandrill, GoDaddy Hosting supported.

== Description ==

WP Email Template 2 things - beautifully

1. Applies a responsive, customizable, optimized HTML email template to every email sent from your WordPress site including plugin generated emails.

2. Gets your beautiful / professional emails delivered. Easily Configure advanced email sending providers with SMTP, Gmail SMTP or Mandrill (API or SMTP)

= Email Template =

The plugin applies a HTML template to email sent from your WordPress site. The Template is optimized to show your HTML emails perfectly in the10 most popular email browsers.

* Apple iOS Devices
* MS Outlook
* Hotmail
* Apple Mail
* Yahoo! Mail
* Google Gmail
* Android Devices
* Windows Live Desktop
* Mozilla Thunderbird

= Email Sending Options =

The biggest issue users have are:

* Email Spammers make successful email delivery a very complicated and specialized function.
* WordPress by default uses your web hosts local mail server to send all WordPress and plugin generated emails.
* Emails sent from a web host local mail server have poor delivery rates because they have very little or no reputation.
* Configuring any type of email delivery provider will improve email delivery rates.

Every different Email Provider requires another plugin to configure. For example here are just a few of the available choices.

* Send Email via SMTP - [WP SMTP Mail](http://http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/), [WP SMPT](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smtp/), [Easy WP SMTP](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-wp-smtp/)
* Send Email via Gmail SMTP - [SendPress Lite](http://wordpress.org/plugins/sendpress/) and any SMTP plugin if you know what you are doing.
* Send Email via Mandrill - [wpMandrill](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpmandrill/)
* Send via WordPress default 'local mail server' if using GoDaddy Hosting - Auto Config WordPress default Email Sending - [SendPress Lite](http://wordpress.org/plugins/sendpress/)

At a3rev we want users to be able to

1. Create a Beautiful / Professional HTML Email template.
2. Auto apply that template to all emails sent from WordPress and installed plugins.
3. Easily configure a sending provider to get those emails delivered.
4. Do it all with one plugin, quickly and easily.

That is why we have added the Email Sending Provider Configuration Options so you can do all of that with just one plugin - WP Email Template.

= Email from WordPress Plugins =

WP Email Template will not work with any plugin that:

1. Applies it's own HTML Email Template (WP Email Template is still applied but the 2 together will look bad).
2. Send it's emails via the php() function. WP Email Template is applied to all mail that goes through wp_mail()

Some of the better known plugins of the 1,000's of plugins that WP Email Template works beautifully with.

* Gravity Forms - see the screen shots - looks sensational with the default Gravity style.
* Contact Form 7 - see the screenshots
* WP e-Commerce - applies the template to every store generated email to customers and admins
* WooCommerce - Version 2.1 and backward compatible. By default the plugin ignores WooCommerce email output - but you can choose to apply your WordPress Email Template to all Woocomerce emails to give you consistent branding across your entire site.
* WP Mail SMPT - WP Email Template does not interfere with the way any WordPress or any plugin handles email output - it just applies the template to any output content.
* BackupBuddy - I love it when even my admin emails are branded - see the screenshots
* Wordfence - Branded security emails - nice.

= Mobile Responsive App style admin interface =

* 100% compatible with WordPress v3.8.0 and later admin interface.
* Backward compatibility to WordPress v3.5.0
* App style admin interface.
* Admin app interface is fully mobile and tablet responsive.

= a3rev Plugins Lite & Pro Version Admin Interface =

* All a3rev Lite Version plugins have exactly the same admin interface as the Pro Version.
* Pro Version features and settings are inside of a Yellow border.
* The Pro Version settings are all active on the admin panels But do not save and are not applied to the front end.
* Upgrading to the Pro version activates all the Pro version Features and Settings and removes the Yellow side bar and borders.

>= Premium Support =

>The a3rev team does not provide support for the WP Email Template plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One on one developer support is available via the plugins a3rev [support forum](https://a3rev.com/forums/forum/wordpress-plugins/wp-email-template/) to people who have purchased a [WP Email Template Pro](http://a3rev.com/shop/wp-email-template/) plugin Lifetime License.

>The Pro Version has lots of extra features that coupled with developer support might be well worth your investment!

= The Pro Version Upgrade =

* Wow your web clients and customers with an email template that perfectly matches the site design.
* We use it on every site we do and it just blows the client away.
* Best thing of all it takes just minutes to do.
* Our clients love tweaking the design with the point and click settings.

* Fix - Email template header image not showing in outbound email template and preview. Header image was uploading and showing correctly in the admin panel under upload input but not showing in template applied to outbound emails and preview.

= 1.0.5 - 2013/04/16 =
* Feature - Added when install and activate plugin link redirects to WP Email Template admin panel instead of the wp-plugins dashboard
* Fix - Yahoo Mail does not support p tag - space between paragraphs. Coded in line CSS fix to auto add space between paragraphs for Yahoo Mail.

* Fix - Updated all JavaScript functions so that the plugin is compatible with jQuery Version1.9 and backwards to version 1.6. WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9.

* Fix - Max wide layout issues with template display in iPhone 5.
* Fix - Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing the email template preview to show a -1 instead of the Template because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php?action=preview_wp_email_template is http: and it is denied hence was returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Email Template Preview action now automatically detects that and works as it should.

= 1.0.1 - 2013/01/09 =
* Tweak - Updated Support and Pro Version link URL's on wordpress.org description, plugins and plugins dashboard. Links were returning 404 errors since the launch of the all new a3rev.com mobile responsive site as the base e-commerce permalinks is changed.
* Fix - When user server does not support  file_get_contents function changes made to the template were not applying to the WooCommerce Email template. We had added a get file from get_stylesheet_directory_uri constant as a work around but had missed the () at the end of the function so it wasn't working
