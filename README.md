# cryns-family-music-archives
A plugin + theme that generates mp3 playlists for the Cryns Family Music Archives.

* The plugin works out of the box.  
* I have included a handy cryns_audio_playlist() function that you can use in your archive.php template file (or equivalent).
* The theme is completely unnecessary, and the plugin will work on any theme.

ROADMAP:
1. Create custom field UI for Audio File field.
2. Maybe use media library rather than posts...not sure about this, because we would need to use media meta, which is not really in most people's workflows...
